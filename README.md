## Face Recognition based Attendance Management System (FRAMS)
Face Recognition based Attendance Management System with an attendance dashboard in Power BI

### 1. Setting up the Environment
- Created and activated a conda environment.
- Installed necessary dependencies including OpenCV, dlib, face-recognition, sqlite, and Flask.

### 2. Face Detection
- Utilized the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method to detect faces in images and video streams.
- Implemented face detection using the dlib library.

### 3. Facial Image Processing
- Warped facial images to ensure eyes and lips were centered.
- Located 68 facial landmarks to align the face.

### 4. Face Embedding
- Generated 128-dimensional feature vectors to uniquely represent faces using the face_recognition library.
- Trained the model using the triplet loss function to distinguish between similar and dissimilar faces.

### 5. Face Recognition
- Utilized Euclidean distance with a threshold of 0.5 to compare the generated face encodings with the actual encodings of the training images to recognize the faces.

### 6. Database Integration
- Used the sqlite Python module to store attendance data.
- Exported data to CSV for integration with Power BI.

### 7. Web Application
- Developed a web app using Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
- Provided a user-friendly interface for attendance punching and viewing reports.

### 8. Data Visualization
- Connected the attendance data to Power BI to create interactive dashboards.
- Embedded Power BI reports into the web app for real-time insights.
